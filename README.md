# Ably Terraform Provider

_[Ably](https://ably.com) is the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or monitoring live car performance data – consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Bloomberg, HubSpot, Verizon, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale. For more information, see the [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/docs)._

This is a Terraform provider for Ably that enables you to manage your Ably account using IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code), including managing your applications, namespaces, keys, queues, rules and more.

## Supported platforms

This provider supports the following systems/architectures:

- Darwin / AMD64
- Darwin / ARMv8
- Linux / AMD64 (this is required for usage in Terraform Cloud, see below)
- Linux / ARMv8 (sometimes referred to as AArch64 or ARM64)
- Linux / ARMv6
- Windows / AMD64

This provider is built on top of Terraform Protocol 6.0, which is compatible with Terraform CLI version 1.0 and later (see more: [Terraform Plugin Protocol v6](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol#protocol-version-6)).

## Installation

To install Ably Terraform provider:

1. Create a Control API token by logging into your Ably account and going to https://ably.com/users/access_tokens (Account -> My Access Tokens). This token should have permissions for the operations that you plan to do with Terraform provider. More details are available in [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/docs/control-api#authentication).
2. Set the environment variable `ABLY_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` to the token you have created.
3. Add the following to your Terraform configuration file

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ably = {
      source  = "ably/ably"
      version = "0.6.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "ably" {
}
```

4. (Optional) Alternatively you can also specify Control API token in the provider configuration directly:

```terraform
provider "ably" {
  token = <Control API token>
}
```

  name                      = "ably-tf-provider-app-0000"
  status                    = "enabled"
  tls_only                  = true
}

# Add a key
resource "ably_api_key" "api_key_0" {
  app_id = ably_app.app0.id
  name   = "key-0000"
  capabilities = {
    "channel2" = ["publish"],
    "channel3" = ["subscribe"],
    "channel33" = ["subscribe"],
  }
}

# Configure a queue
resource "ably_queue" "example_queue" {
  app_id     = ably_app.app0.id
  name       = "queue_name"
  ttl        = 60
  max_length = 10000
  region     = "us-east-1-a"
