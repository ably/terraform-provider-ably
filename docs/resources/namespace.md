# ably_namespace (Resource)

The ably_namespace resource allows you to manage namespaces for channel rules in Ably. Read more in the Ably documentation: https://ably.com/docs/general/channel-rules-namespaces.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ably_namespace" "namespace0" {
  app_id            = ably_app.app0.id
  id                = "namespace"
  authenticated     = false
  persisted         = false
  persist_last      = false
  push_enabled      = false
  tls_only          = false
  expose_timeserial = false
}

resource "ably_namespace" "namespace_batching" {
  app_id            = ably_app.app0.id
  id                = "namespace"
  authenticated     = false
  persisted         = false
  persist_last      = false
  push_enabled      = false
  tls_only          = false
  expose_timeserial = false
  batching_enabled  = true
  batching_interval = 100
}

resource "ably_namespace" "namespace_conflation" {
  app_id              = ably_app.app0.id
  id                  = "namespace"
  authenticated       = false
  persisted           = false
  persist_last        = false
  push_enabled        = false
  tls_only            = false
  expose_timeserial   = false
  conflation_enabled  = true
  conflation_interval = 1000
  conflation_key      = "example"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `app_id` (String) The application ID.
- `id` (String) The namespace or channel name that the channel rule will apply to.

### Optional

- `authenticated` (Boolean) Require clients to be authenticated to use channels in this namespace.
- `batching_enabled` (Boolean) If true, channels within this namespace will start batching inbound messages instead of sending them out immediately to subscribers as per the configured policy.
- `batching_interval` (Number) When configured, sets the maximium batching interval in the channel.
- `conflation_enabled` (Boolean) If true, enables conflation for channels within this namespace. Conflation reduces the number of messages sent to subscribers by combining multiple messages into a single message.
- `conflation_interval` (Number) The interval in milliseconds at which messages are conflated. This determines how frequently messages are combined into a single message.
- `conflation_key` (String) The key used to determine which messages should be conflated. Messages with the same conflation key will be combined into a single message.
- `expose_timeserial` (Boolean) If true, messages received on a channel will contain a unique timeserial that can be referenced by later messages for use with message interactions.
- `persist_last` (Boolean) If true, the last message on each channel will persist for 365 days.
- `persisted` (Boolean) If true, messages will be stored for 24 hours.
- `push_enabled` (Boolean) If true, publishing messages with a push payload in the extras field is permitted.
- `tls_only` (Boolean) If true, only clients that are connected using TLS will be permitted to subscribe.
